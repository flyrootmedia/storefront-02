## A mock Product Listing Page built with React

### Concepts Demonstrated

- Functional components with *hooks*
- React Router - *history*, *Link* *NavLink*
- Redux / Redux Thunk
- *async/await* with *fetch*
- SASS

### [Project Site](https://kind-dubinsky-34fc0b.netlify.app/)

**NOTE:** This app is my first experimentation with React outside of courses/tutorials. 
It's currently set up with a mock api that doesn't pull from a database, so doesn't support filtering/sorting, 
or pagination. To get around this and make it feel a little less broken I'm performing these actions in the front end, 
which I know is unrealistic and expensve, and makes it feel a bit wonky. The filters aren't taking into account which 
ones should be additive or subtractive, and the counts are kind of messed up because of that.

This is a work in progress and is a portfolio project, so I'd welcome issues created for any suggestions or bugs, but I won't 
accept any pull requests since I would like this to remain all my own code.
